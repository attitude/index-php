# index.php [devtool]

Walks the directory tree and generates `index.php` files for deeply nested file structures.

## Using via command line

Only `-path` parameter is required. Use `-dry on` to test results. Turn `-backup off` as soon as you don't need backups and nothing gets lost/overwritten.

```
$ /path/to/index-php/run.sh -path "/to/walk"
```
